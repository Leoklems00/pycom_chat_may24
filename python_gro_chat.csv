Good evening house 🙌🏽

This is to inform the house that one of our Community Managers Miss Peace IJ, and one of our Program Managers Mr Kene are no longer serving in the above mentioned capacities due to some circumstances. We really appreciate them for their effort and sincerity and we pray God continues to bless and keep them.

To that effect we will need replacement each for Community Manager and Program Manager. Interested persons should notify me privately so we can work together to better the community.

Long live Python Community Anambra.

"7/22/23, 8:30 PM", ~klemz:,message," This is a superb question and the Ans is -
C. [[0, 'python', 0], [0, 'python', 0], [0, 'python', 0]]

🚀🔥The really crucial point for solving this problem is about how Python handles list multiplication, by NOT creating multiple separate lists, BUT by creating multiple references to the same list. This is crucial in understanding the output of this code🚀🚀

Let's dive in

---------------------
👉 First, we're creating a list with the line `matrix = [[0] * 3] * 3`.

Here, the expression `[0] * 3` is creating a list of three zeroes `[0, 0, 0]`.

Then, `[[0] * 3] * 3` is attempting to create a list of three of these lists.

So after `matrix = [[0] * 3] * 3` the `matrix` variable creating a 3x3 matrix of zeroes like this:

```
[[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0]]
```

👉 However, there's a tricky thing happening here due to how Python handles list multiplication.

👉 💡🔥When you multiply a list by an integer in Python, it doesn't create new, separate lists. Instead, it creates references to the same list. This means that although it appears as if you've created three separate lists, you've in fact created three references to the same list. This is crucial in understanding the output of this code.🔥

👉 Next, the line `matrix[1][1] = ""python""` is setting the second element of the second list to ""python"".

🔥But remember, all 3 lists in `matrix` are actually the same list in memory due to the way we created `matrix`.

🔥So this operation is changing this shared list, which impacts ALL 3 ""rows"" in `matrix`.

👉 Finally, when you print `matrix`, you're seeing the change reflected across all 3 lists (which, again, are actually the same list in memory). So the output is:

```
[[0, 'python', 0], [0, 'python', 0], [0, 'python', 0]]
```

To conclude, the behaviour you see here is a result of how Python handles list multiplication.

If you wanted to create a 3x3 matrix where each list was independent, you could use a list comprehension to ensure each list is a separate object in memory",2023-07-22,20:30:00,2023,7,22

"8/15/23, 10:24 PM", Okeoma GeoStat:,message," *What is AI?*
Artificial Intelligence, refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. These tasks can include things like problem-solving, learning from experience, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. AI systems are designed to process large amounts of data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.

*Will AI Replace Programming?*
The massive adoption of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools is rapidly reshaping our society. The current AI boom will affect nearly every sector of the economy, with implications that are still difficult to foresee. The fields of software development and data science are no exception. Indeed, following the advent of ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and other AI-powered tools, the industry is sparking speculation about the future of coding. Will AI replace programming? We cannot read the future, but the short and most likely answer is that it won’t, at least in the near future. However, as developers and data professionals incorporate these AI tools into their toolboxes, their role as programmers may well change forever, as will the nature of their tasks.

*The Limitations of AI in Programming*
Despite the ground-breaking results of generative AI tools, the technology is not yet mature enough to replace programmers. In other words, while generative AI like ChatGPT can be used for a wide range of downstream tasks, bringing us closer to the idea of Artificial General Intelligence (a hypothetical level of AI which can accomplish any intellectual task that human beings or animals can perform), it is still unable to think or behave like humans.
State-of-the-art AI still lacks the human creativity, intuition, and domain expertise that is very much required in programming. While AI can help in many coding tasks and even boost creativity, it’s for humans to conceptualize complex systems, understand business problems, and make strategic decisions.
Also, despite its impressive results, there are several risks and challenges associated with AI that make human oversight mandatory, especially when AI-supported decisions can have significant implications for individuals and society.
Finally, AI systems are trained on historical data, meaning that they may not always keep up with the latest developments in the fast-paced domains of software development and data science. Hence, while AI can succeed in mastering consolidated knowledge, it’s for humans to expand the boundaries of knowledge, developing new tools, techniques and paradigms.

*The Future of Programming*
Rather than AI replacing developers, it will likely reshape their role. Collaboration is the most likely scenario for the coming future. Equipped with next-generation AI tools, developers will be relieved from mundane, time-consuming routines. This shift will allow them to focus on more innovative and challenging tasks.
Overall, adopting AI will speed up software and data development processes, increasing productivity and efficiency. The “augmented” development movement that AI will bring about has the potential to simplify programming and make it more accessible, as a wide range of programming tasks can be by now performed with plain human language in a matter of seconds.
This augmentation may translate into a reduction of entry-level programming jobs, for many of the tasks traditionally done by junior coders will be automated or simplified by generative AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot.
But AI tools are far from perfect and bulletproof. Human oversight is essential to ensure that they only deliver positive outcomes. This will open up new opportunities for developers, whose responsibilities will partly shift towards overseeing and managing AI systems. In this sense, developers and data scientists with machine learning and AI ethics skills will likely be in high demand.

*Will AI replace programmers? The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts significant growth in this area*

*Conclusion*
The surge of Artificial Intelligence is reshaping the landscape of programming and generating discussions about its potential to replace programmers, the prevailing consensus suggests that AI won't entirely replace them in the foreseeable future. Instead, AI will likely serve as a powerful tool that augments developers' capabilities, streamlining routine tasks and fostering collaboration. The distinctive human qualities of creativity, intuition, and domain expertise remain irreplaceable in programming, emphasizing the ongoing need for human oversight and ethical considerations in the integration of AI. As the relationship between AI and programmers evolves, developers equipped with AI ethics and machine learning skills will play a pivotal role in shaping the collaborative and harmonious synergy between human ingenuity and artificial intelligence.",2023-08-15,22:24:00,2023,8,15

Good evening everone, I hope this message finds you well. I am sorry that this is not coming in due time.

I want to use this opportunity to appreciate all those that worked with us  to ensure a successful 2023 for our community especially @2347067862298 @2349066469066 @2348093773330 @2347053059459 @2348060927604 @2348026682424 @2348174527371 @2348143651569 @2348132180216 @2347068174520 @2348100457328 @2348088083472 @2347089847744 @2349067677117 @2348032638979  just to mention a few, I remain very grateful for your contributions.

In 2023, we were able to organize two webinars and and one python training series. All didn't go as planned but thankfully we executed the programs with some degree of success and it also taught us some lessons which will help us in our planning and execution of programs this year.

For the year 2024, I have met with my excos and we have agreed to consolidate on the gains of last year by:

1. Collaborating and Participating actively in the activity of PYTHON NIGERIA whenever they have a program.

2. Organizing a few community webinars on our own.

3. Listening to your advices on how to improve the community.

4. Collaboration with other communities and implementing such programs as will benefit the community.

Generally, I want to plead with all to *support and participate* in our activities this year so as to better our community. Note that Python Community Anambra is a tech community hence *all kinds of tech engagements that will enhance the growth of members is welcomed*, be it
- job opportunities,
- announcements,
- projects and reviews,
- challenges,
- questions etc.
So please do not hesitate to use this platform for these🙏🏾.

God willing and with your support and active participation this community will continue to grow and make difference in the lives of members and the society.

Thanks once again and remain blessed. God bless Python Community(PyCom) Anambra 🙏🏾🙌🏽

"2/19/24, 10:16 AM", ~klemz:,message," 🚨 *Announcement* 🚨

I want to begin by appreciating everyone for their contribution so far to moving the community forward especially those who responded to our survey. Even though only about 44 persons responded, we will make progress with that while we still hope that others will do the needful.

The excos have reviewed our responses and based on that have come up with the following ideas to improve the community.

1. We will leave the current ""Data Community"" that we are currently in and build a WhatsApp community around Python Community Anambra so as to better manage the community.

2. We will create atleast four sub groups, three to handle teams including Data Science, Data Analysis and Web development. One sub group for beginners and newbie in the Python world.

3. Only those that responded to the survey will be added to the sub groups so that they can get personalized attention and content for the good of everyone.

4. Most persons prefer Skill development trainings and project challenge over webinars. This will be well attended to in the sub groups as most of our engagements will now happen at the subgroup level.

5. To achieve these targets we will need the support and corporation of everyone hence if we use the personal information provided in the survey to contact anyone, please give us due attention 🙏🏾.

6. A good number of persons will really like a physical session. To that regard if you know any useful partnership that will help us achieve a physical meetup or training, do well to notify us. This is very important as partnership is very key to meeting some of our targets.

Sequel to the above we will be communicated information relevant to it's implementation.

Once again I want to on behalf of my leadership team appreciate everything for their contribution, commitment and support as I continue to seek your support moving on. Remember that any relevant information regarding the program of this community is graciously welcomed.

God bless Python Community Anambra.🙌🏽

Good evening everyone, I hope you are all well...

I will like to use this opportunity to appreciate @2347067862298 and @2349066469066 for their services in the positions of vice president and media manager respectively, unfortunately for some reasons they will not continue to serve in the above positions. While they served us we enjoyed the fruit of their service in some of the programs we organized last year, Python Community Anambra remains ever grateful and we look to work together sometime in future.

Moving on I will equally like to present you with Okeoma Ugochukwu @2349025717748 and Joseph Eneji @2349080139414 who will hence serve us as media manager and program manager respectively. I plead with the community to support them with our corporation as we work towards improving our community.

I continue to appreciate everything who has continued to be of service to this community, may God continue to bless us all.

Long live Python Community Anambra.

I want to thank everyone that made our webinar today a success. Specially I want to mention our speaker Mrs ONYINYECHI NMECHA @2348135944421 who took here time to educate us on the things we need to know while navigating the tech space, most persons neglect that hence the tech industry becomes too tough. Thanks you for opening our eyes.
I also appreciate the team that put together this wonderful seminar especially @2348093773330 and @2349080139414 . You did a wonderful job.
I equally appreciate all those that were in attendance, I recognized a few of us, it was nice seeing you all.🙌🏾

Those that did not attend too 😁 I don't even know why but thank you 🙌🏾

God bless us all.
Long live Python Community Anambra 🙏🏾🙌🏽

I hope this message finds you well.

I want to use this opportunity to notify the general house that Python Community Anambra has now *officially* identified with Python Nigeria. Though long overdue but it's now done. I appreciate all those who formed and kept this community running until now, we are here today because of your efforts and sacrifices, God bless you all.

Sequel to that I want to introduce Mrs Ifechukwu Okoye @2347067123648, an experienced fellow, with whom I will be leading to community. We two are the community leads of python community Anambra.

I want to thank you all for your continued support as I plead that you don't get tired. We are nothing without you all, let's continue to make our own inputs which together will result in success.

Thanks you all and remain blessed 🙌🏾

"4/27/24, 9:15 AM", ~klemz:,message," I got a lot of request from users asking for help in refining resume. So, I thought to share some valuable tips in this post itself for everyone's benefit.

Here are some few key points to note while refining your resume:

Format and Design: Keep your resume clean and professional. Use a modern and easy-to-read font. Utilize clear headings and bullet points for a structured look.

Contact Information: Include your name, phone number, professional email address, and LinkedIn profile (if applicable) at the top of the resume.

Summary or Objective: Write a concise summary or objective statement that highlights your career goals and what you bring to the table.

Professional Experience: List your work experience in reverse chronological order (most recent first). Use action verbs to describe your accomplishments and focus on quantifiable achievements.

Skills: Highlight relevant technical and soft skills. Tailor this section to the specific job you're applying for.

Education: Include your educational background, listing your most recent degree first. Mention any honors or relevant coursework.

Certifications and Training: If you have relevant certifications or training, list them here.

Projects or Portfolio: Showcase any significant projects or a portfolio of your work if it's relevant to the position.

Keywords: Customize your resume for each job application by incorporating keywords from the job posting. This can help your resume pass through applicant tracking systems (ATS).

Proofread: Carefully proofread your resume for grammar and spelling errors. Consider having someone else review it as well.

Tailor Each Resume: Customize your resume for each job application to emphasize the skills and experiences most relevant to that position.

Quantify Achievements: Whenever possible, use specific numbers or percentages to quantify your achievements. This adds credibility to your claims.

Use Action Words: Start bullet points with strong action verbs like ""managed,"" ""achieved,"" ""led,"" etc.

Keep it Concise: Aim for a resume length of one page for less experienced candidates and up to two pages for more experienced professionals.

Update Regularly: Continuously update your resume to reflect your latest experiences and accomplishments.

Seek Feedback: Don't hesitate to seek feedback from mentors, career advisors, or professional colleagues to improve your resume.

Remember that your resume is your marketing tool, so it should effectively communicate your qualifications and value to potential employers. Tailoring it to each job application and staying up-to-date with current resume trends is crucial for success in 2023.

Hope it helps 🙌🏾",2024-04-27,09:15:00,2024,4,27
